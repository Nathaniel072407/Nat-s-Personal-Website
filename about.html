                <h2>Hi, I'm Pacamalan Nathaniel</h2>
                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>Hi my friend! My name is Nathaniel, a dedicated web developer and designer located in Imus Cavite. Technology has always captivated me and influenced the world we live in. I started my web development journey by making my first website as a personal project, and ever since, I have focused on improving my skills and designing captivating web experiences.</p>
                <p>I believe that quality design should serve a purpose and be visually appealing. I use both creative skills and technical knowledge in my work to create user-friendly websites that are visually attractive. I have expertise in HTML, CSS, and CSS GRID and I am always seeking new technologies and frameworks to enhance my skills.</p>
                <p>In my free time, I enjoy discovering fresh hiking paths, immersing myself in captivating books, or trying out new recipes in the kitchen. I am a firm supporter of continuous learning and enjoy taking part in online courses and workshops to maintain my skills.</p>
                <p>I'm always eager to collaborate on fresh projects, regardless of their size. If you want to get in touch, please don't hesitate to contact me via the contact page!</p>
                <p>And also I have personal experience in farming, like planting corn. It's tiring but enjoyable, especially when you're doing it with friends who are also planting.</p>
                <h3>My Personal experiences.</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li> <p>I have personal experience in farming when I was a kid, like planting corn. It's tiring but enjoyable, especially when you're doing it with friends who are also planting.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Planting corn was one of my wonderful experiences when I was in the province because you can learn valuable lessons from it. 
                        One lesson I picked up is that money isn't earned quickly, so you should use it wisely and properly, as you have to work hard for it before you can have it.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Based on my personal experience in the fields as a farmer, you cannot afford to be lazy because your earnings depend on your hard work.</p></li>
                <h3>Also In HTML, CSS, And CSS GRID experience.</h3>
                    <li><p>Making use of HTML, CSS, and CSS Grid has been a fulfilling creative and problem-solving experience. Re-creating a Mondrian artwork was one of my favorite efforts. I had to use CSS Grid for exact placement and scaling because of the simple geometric shapes and striking primary colors. To create the composition, I used grid-template-areas and fractional units. I gained a deeper understanding of layout alignment and learned how to convert abstract drawings into structured code through this assignment. Creating an online CV was another fascinating project. I wanted my profile, talents, expertise, and contact information to have a simple, contemporary appearance. The material was arranged into a polished layout thanks in large part to CSS Grid. Using media queries, I incorporated responsive features to make sure the CV looked fantastic on all screens.</p></li>
                    <li><p>I was able to put accessibility guidelines like using semantic HTML and alt attributes for icons and images into reality thanks to this project.  I experimented with responsiveness and interaction when creating a landing page. I created call-to-action buttons, feature highlights, and hero sections using grid-based layouts. I used CSS animations and hover effects to create a dynamic and captivating page. I advanced my responsive design abilities by using media queries to make sure the design changed fluidly to different screen sizes.  I also liked working on smaller, more significant projects, like using HTML and CSS Grid to create the Laos flag. This was an enjoyable approach to learn layering and grid alignment. I was able to effectively integrate typographic and design ideas when I created a birthday invitation and a motivating poster. </p></li>
